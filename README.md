- Database bootstrap script is in extra/ directory, I used MS SQL Server 16 for this, so there is some SQLserver specific syntax

- DB is configured with spring JDBC in application.settings

- I used java 17 and gradle for the build with spring boot

- sample queries in extra folder exported from insomnia rest client

- I would have liked to add some unit tests but decided to focus on the actual
  functionality, I tried to keep testability in mind though.

- to start it run the gradle bootrun target
